# Distributed Energy Resources Integrated Virtual Environment (DERIVE)

#### Digital-Twin Simulation Solution for Integrated Energy Systems
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## General
Integrated energy systems (IES) describe a holistic approach to finding coordinated energy and economic solutions. IES have the potential to mitigate inequities which can arise from grid, space, or economic limitations. The Distributed Energy Resources Integrated Virtual Environment (DERIVE) package introduces a simulation environment to model IES and provides a parametric analysis of battery sizes through an optimal control strategy to assess the potential of IES.

## Getting Started
The following link permits users to clone the source directory containing the [DERIVE](https://github.com/LBNL-ETA/DERIVE) package and then locally install with the `pip install .` command.

## Examples
To illustrate the DERIVE functionality, example Jupyter notebooks can be found [here](https://github.com/LBNL-ETA/DERIVE/blob/master/examples/).

[Example 1](https://github.com/LBNL-ETA/DERIVE/blob/master/examples/Simplified%20Local%20vs%20Global%20(MPC).ipynb) shows a comparison between local and integrated control of resources.
